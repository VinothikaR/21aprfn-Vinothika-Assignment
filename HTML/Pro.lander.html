            <b>Answer:</b> 
            <ul>
                <li>Easy syntax and readability</li>
                <li>Interpreted and dynamically typed</li>

        <b>3. Explain the difference between Python 2.x and Python 3.x.</b>
        <br><br>
        <article> <b>Answer:</b> 
        <ul>
            <li>Python 3.x is the latest version and is not backward compatible with Python 2.x. Key differences include:</li>
            <li>Print function: In Python 2.x, print is a statement, while in Python 3.x, it is a function.</li>
            <li>Integer division: Python 2.x performs integer division by default, while Python 3.x returns a float result.</li>
            <li>Unicode: Python 3.x uses Unicode for string handling by default, while Python 2.x uses ASCII.</li>

        <b>4. What are lists and tuples in Python?</b>

        <article><br>
            <b>Answer:</b> 
            <ul>
                <li>Lists: Ordered, mutable collections of items. They allow you to modify, add, and remove elements.</li>
                <li>Tuples: Ordered, immutable collections of items. Once created, their elements cannot be changed.</li>

    <section id="5. What is the difference between append() and extend() in a list?">
        <b>5. What is the difference between append() and extend() in a list?</b>
        <article><br>
            <b>Answer:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>append() adds an element as a single item to the list.</li>
                <li>extend() adds multiple elements (from another iterable) to the list.</li>
            </ul>
            <b>Example:</b>
            <p>
                list1 = [1, 2] <br>
                list1.append([3, 4])  # Output: [1, 2, [3, 4]] <br>
                list1.extend([5, 6])  # Output: [1, 2, [3, 4], 5, 6]</p>

        <b>6. What are Python's built-in data types?</b>
        <article><br>
            <b>Answer:</b> The main built-in data types in Python are:
            <ul>
                <li>Numeric types: int, float, complex</li>
                <li>- Sequence types: list, tuple, range</li>
                <li>Text type: str</li>
                <li>Mapping type: dict</li>
                <li>Set types: set, frozenset</li>
                <li>Boolean type: bool</li>
                <li>Binary types: bytes, bytearray, memoryview
                </li>

    <section id="7. What is a dictionary in Python?">
        <b>7. What is a dictionary in Python?</b>
        <article><br>
            <b>Answer:</b> <br>
            A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Keys are unique, and values can be any data type. Dictionaries are created using curly braces {}. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Example:</b>
            <p>my_dict = {"name": "John", "age": 25}</p>

    <section id="8. What are functions in Python?">
        <b>8. What are functions in Python?</b>
        <article><br>
            <b>Answer:</b> <br>
            Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They are defined using the def keyword.
            <b>Example:</b>
            <p>def greet(name): <br>
            &emsp;print(f"Hello, {name}")</p>
